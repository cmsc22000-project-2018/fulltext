This directory contains pseudocodes for the program, representing how 
different classes interact.

Please keep these files updated for documentation.

Explanation of format
- The pseudocode is meant to be read as a written out version of actual code.
- The symbol (-) represents different options.
- The symbol ([]) represents a specific function to accomplish the given task.
   - Within ([]), text in all caps represent class name.
   - If no class is yet designated for the functions, NC will be used for No 
     Class.
   - The function names could be different if this file is not updated 
     periodically.
   - If no function was present in the design documentation at the time of 
     creating this file, the author's discretion was used to name the function.
