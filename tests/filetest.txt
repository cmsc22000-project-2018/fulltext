Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. It is a long established fact
that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking
at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less
normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content
here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages
and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a
search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.
Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes
on purpose (injected humour and the like). In the field of computer science,
a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear
ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge uv from vertex u
to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of
the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent
constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application,
a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. A topological
ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is,
if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Any DAG has at least one topological
ordering, and algorithms are known for constructing a topological ordering of
any DAG in linear time.
