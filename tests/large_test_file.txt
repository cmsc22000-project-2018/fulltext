A trie for keys "A","to", "tea", "ted", "ten", "i", "in", and "inn".
In computer science, a trie, also called digital tree and sometimes radix tree or prefix tree (as they can be searched by prefixes), is a 
kind of search treeâan ordered tree data structure that is used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually 
strings. Unlike a binary search tree, no node in the tree stores the key associated with that node; instead, its position in the tree 
defines the key with which it is associated. All the descendants of a node have a common prefix of the string associated with that node, 
and the root is associated with the empty string. Values are not necessarily associated with every node. Rather, values tend only to be 
associated with leaves, and with some inner nodes that correspond to keys of interest. For the space-optimized presentation of prefix 
tree, see compact prefix tree.
In the example shown, keys are listed in the nodes and values below them. Each complete English word has an arbitrary integer value 
associated with it. A trie can be seen as a tree-shaped deterministic finite automaton. Each finite language is generated by a trie 
automaton, and each trie can be compressed into a deterministic acyclic finite state automaton.
Though tries are usually keyed by character strings, not verified in body they need not be. The same algorithms can be adapted to serve 
similar functions of ordered lists of any construct, e.g. permutations on a list of digits or shapes. In particular, a bitwise trie is 
keyed on the individual bits making up any fixed-length binary datum, such as an integer or memory address.
As discussed below, a trie has a number of advantages over binary search trees. A trie can also be used to replace a hash table, over 
which it has the following advantages:
Looking up data in a trie is faster in the worst case, O(m) time (where m is the length of a search string), compared to an imperfect hash 
table. An imperfect hash table can have key collisions. A key collision is the hash function mapping of different keys to the same 
position in a hash table. The worst-case lookup speed in an imperfect hash table is O(N) time, but far more typically is O(1), with O(m) 
time spent evaluating the hash.
There are no collisions of different keys in a trie.
Buckets in a trie, which are analogous to hash table buckets that store key collisions, are necessary only if a single key is associated 
with more than one value.
There is no need to provide a hash function or to change hash functions as more keys are added to a trie.
A trie can provide an alphabetical ordering of the entries by key.
Tries do have some drawbacks as well:
Tries can be slower in some cases than hash tables for looking up data, especially if the data is directly accessed on a hard disk drive 
or some other secondary storage device where the random-access time is high compared to main memory.
Some keys, such as floating point numbers, can lead to long chains and prefixes that are not particularly meaningful. Nevertheless, a 
bitwise trie can handle standard IEEE single and double format floating point numbers.
Some tries can require more space than a hash table, as memory may be allocated for each character in the search string, rather than a 
single chunk of memory for the whole entry, as in most hash tables.
The Coppa Acerbo races were held over a 24â26 km (15â16 mi) circuit, beginning and ending at Pescara, on the Adriatic coast. The course 
layout featured an inland route through the Abruzzo hills, that passed through several villages, followed by a long, straight descent back 
to the coast, where a tight right-hand corner led on to a four-mile (6 km) long straight running next to the sea. The pit and paddock 
complex was located at the end of this straight. In an effort to slow competitor speeds past these pits the Pescara circuit became one of 
the first to have an artificial chicane installed, just before the pit lane. The Pescara circuit layout holds the record as the longest 
circuit to ever to host a Formula One World Championship event, with the NÃ¼rburgring Nordschleife coming second at about 23 km.
In March 1924 the Central Secretariat of the Communist Party (bolshevik) of Azerbaijan instructed its German Section to set up a 
publication to be distributed amongst German colonists. But the preparations for the setting up of a German-language newspaper in the 
Caucasus were marred by difficulties. There was a lack of skilled German-speaking staff and German Gothic fonts had to be purchased from 
Georgia and Ganja. Between March and April 1924 a publication called 'Rote Bauer' ('Red Peasant') was circulated amongst German colonists, 
but its circulation was limited to a hundred copies. Moreover, it only covered rural issues. Bauer und Arbeiter on the other hand became a 
regular newspaper covering both urban and rural issues.
Bauer und Arbeiter was a significant feature in the organizing of ideological work amongst the German population in the Transcaucasian 
Socialist Federative Soviet Republic. It covered domestic, economic and cultural issues of the urban and rural German population of 
Azerbaijan and Georgia. For its material the newspaper relied on workers and peasant correspondents (8 workers correspondents in 
Baku, 3 in Tiflis, 15 peasant correspondents in rural Azerbaijan, 7 in Georgia). The focus of the newspaper was more directed towards 
household and day-to-day issues than politics and was characterized by a balanced tone, a fact that made it popular amongst German 
colonists.

During its initial phase, Bauer und Arbeiter had circulation of around 2,200. Most of the printed copies were distributed amongst 
Germans in Baku and German colonists in Azerbaijan, and a lesser number in Georgia and amongst Moscow-based institutions. An editorial 
office was opened in Tiflis, managed by the German Section of the Communist Party (bolshevik) of Georgia.
Initially, the lack of a printing press of its own limited the expansion of the newspaper. It was printed at the Poligraftresta publishing 
company, and there were frequent delays. In September 1924 a private publishing company named 'Bauer und Arbeiter' was set up in Baku by 
Erfurt, P. Kulfeldt and Schoenberg, with the stated goal of printing material for the German Section of the Communist Party.
Whilst the newspaper was rapidly gaining readership during its short life-span, Bauer und Arbeiter was promptly closed down on 5 November 
1924.
